 Work Integrated Learning (WIL) is the term given to an activity or program that 
integrates academic learning with its application in the workplace. The practice 
may be real or simulated and can occur in the workplace, at the university, online,
or face-to-face. Design and develop an application for work-integrated learning
placement that requires a student to register for an internship or project and 
enroll in a specific course. Once done, the student should record their company 
details as well as their supervisor at the workplace. Followed by tracking the 
students' progress for 3 months before they perform their final presentation.
